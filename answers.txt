Lab 1 writeup
===============================

1. Design decisions
This lab didn't really require any major design decisions. However, I did decide to separate out the HeapFileIterator into its own separate class (in its own separate file -- HeapFileIterator.java)

2. API Changes
No changes to the API were made.

3. Missing or incomplete parts of my code for this lab
Everything required in this lab has been completed.

4. How long I spent on the lab / anything I found difficult or confusing
I spent around 5 hours (in one stretch) on the lab. Overall, the lab was fairly straightforward, apart from a few minor things--
  (i) In BufferPool's getPage() method, I wasn't quite sure how to get the tableId corresponding to the given page, and invented a few really hacky ways of accomplishing this, until I realized the right way of doing this.
  (ii) It wasn't immediately quite clear how HeapFile's iterator() method needed to work.

Lab 2 writeup
===============================

1. Design decisions
I used a simple nested loop join, which isn't the most efficient, but is simple to implement.
I used a very simple page eviction policy as well -- I chose a random page in the BufferPool to evict, which is again easy to implement. I will probably improve the policy used for page eviction in future labs.
I also created a separate AggregateIterator that iterates through the output of an aggregate operation.
Also, when inserting a tuple into a new page, I immediately write the new page to the end of the existing file (basically, append a new page to the end of the file)

2. API Changes
No changes to the API were made.

3. Missing or incomplete parts of my code for this lab
Everything required in this lab was completed.

4. How long I spent on the lab / anything I found difficult or confusing
I spent around 5 or 6 hours on the lab, across multiple days. The lab was pretty interesting, and gave me insight into how operations that I basically took for granted before, work under the hood.
I found the JavaDocs confusing in some places (sentences didn't end / were weirdly formatted and incomplete), but beyond that, lab was relatively well-explained. Took me some time to figure out the different methods of class implementing the Operator abstract class needed to work.
